3. Describe in your own words the difference between passing something “by value”
versus “by reference.”


If I hand write an essay and give it to you I am passing the essay by value.  Any
changes made to my essay will alter the original and change the value.  Now if
I were to make ten copies and hand you the copy I am passing by reference.  Changes
made to the copy would not have any impact on my original copy or value contained.


4. Describe in your own words a hash table (hash map) and why you would use it:


A hash table is used to implement an associative array that assigns key value pairs
to specific indexes of the array or indexes to "buckets".  A hashing function is
then used to access the various indexes of the buckets to pull out the data
contained within.
Speed is the main reason you would use a hash table. In addition to this,
if you had an array full of data and knew the position of where a specific item
is stored in said array, you could access that piece of data using a hash table.  I


7. Some programming environments, such as Java Runtime and the .NET Framework
include a feature called garbage collection. In your own words,
what is garbage collection?


Garbage collection is a form of memory management in which objects that are
no longer being used will be discarded.  By doing this memory is being freed up
so other new objects can use that piece of memory. It also allows developers to
not have to manually deallocate said objects.
